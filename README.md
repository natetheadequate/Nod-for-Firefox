======================
*For more information about Nod or to contribute to the author, see **[here](https://github.com/jamieecarr/nod)***

Description
--------
This is a slightly modified version of the Nod Chrome Extension which makes it compatible with Firefox. 
I am unaffiliated with the author of the original extension.
Mozilla code review requires unminified code which is not available to me, thus this cannot be published to the Mozilla addon store.

Installation
--------------
### Load Temporarily 
#### 1) Download Code
Click the green button that says "Code" and then "Download ZIP". 
#### 2) Extract Code
Click the blue downloads icon to the right of the url bar and click Nod-for-Firefox-master. Right click Nod-for-Firefox-Master in the popup and select Extract. Click extract.
#### 3) Load Add-On *(Must be repeated every time Firefox launches)*
Navigate to about:debugging and click "Load Temporary Add-On". Select the folder Nod-for-Firefox-master then the file manifest.json.

### Load Permanently *(requires creating/having a Firefox Developer Account)*
#### 1) Click on the file Nod-for-Firefox.xpi . Click "Download".  
#### 2) Self-sign extension 
Navigate [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addons). Sign in/create an account if necessary. Use a real email address, it will be needed later. Click "Submit a New Add-On". Select "On Your Own" then choose the file Nod-for-Firefox.xpi . Click sign.
#### 3) You will get an email from Mozilla with a link to download the extension.
